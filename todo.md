# Flight Booking Multi-Agent System - Master Todo List

## Project Overview
A multi-agent flight booking system using LangGraph, OpenAI, TypeScript, Next.js, Express.js, and MongoDB.

**Deployment Strategy:**
- Frontend → Vercel
- Backend → Render
- Database → MongoDB Atlas

---

## 🏗️ Phase 1: Project Setup & Infrastructure

### Initial Setup (Can work in parallel)
- [x] Create project folder structure
- [ ] Initialize npm workspaces
- [ ] Create .gitignore
- [ ] Create README.md
- [ ] Push initial structure to GitHub

---

## 📦 Phase 2: Parallel Development (3 Work Streams)

### Backend Development (Claude 1) 🔴
See `claude1-todo.md` for detailed tasks

**High-Level:**
- [ ] Express.js server setup with TypeScript
- [ ] MongoDB connection and models
- [ ] Authentication system (JWT)
- [ ] LangGraph multi-agent orchestration
- [ ] 4 OpenAI agents implementation
- [ ] API endpoints
- [ ] CORS configuration for frontend
- [ ] Environment variables setup

**Dependencies:** Requires MongoDB schemas from Claude 3

---

### Frontend Development (Claude 2) 🔵
See `claude2-todo.md` for detailed tasks

**High-Level:**
- [ ] Next.js 14+ setup with TypeScript
- [ ] Authentication UI (login/register)
- [ ] Chat interface component
- [ ] Booking history view
- [ ] Real-time message handling
- [ ] API client setup
- [ ] Tailwind CSS styling
- [ ] Environment variables setup

**Dependencies:** Can start immediately, connects to backend later

---

### Database & Infrastructure (Claude 3) 🟢
See `claude3-todo.md` for detailed tasks

**High-Level:**
- [ ] MongoDB schema definitions
- [ ] Database connection utilities
- [ ] Seed data for flights
- [ ] Test user data
- [ ] Sample bookings data
- [ ] Database initialization script
- [ ] Environment configuration templates

**Dependencies:** None - can start immediately

---

## 🔗 Phase 3: Integration

### Backend-Frontend Integration
- [ ] Test authentication flow end-to-end
- [ ] Test chat interface with agents
- [ ] Verify booking creation flow
- [ ] Verify flight status retrieval
- [ ] Verify cancellation flow
- [ ] Handle error states in UI

### Database Integration
- [ ] Connect backend to MongoDB
- [ ] Run seed scripts
- [ ] Verify data persistence
- [ ] Test duplicate booking prevention

---

## 🧪 Phase 4: Testing

### Backend Tests
- [ ] Unit tests for agents
- [ ] Integration tests for API endpoints
- [ ] Test duplicate booking logic
- [ ] Test cancellation logic

### Frontend Tests
- [ ] Component tests
- [ ] E2E tests for critical flows
- [ ] UI/UX testing

---

## 🚀 Phase 5: Deployment

### Database Deployment
- [ ] Set up MongoDB Atlas cluster
- [ ] Configure network access
- [ ] Upload seed data to cloud database
- [ ] Get connection string

### Backend Deployment (Render)
- [ ] Create Render web service
- [ ] Configure environment variables
- [ ] Set build/start commands
- [ ] Deploy and test
- [ ] Get backend URL

### Frontend Deployment (Vercel)
- [ ] Connect GitHub repo to Vercel
- [ ] Configure environment variables (API URL)
- [ ] Set root directory to `frontend/`
- [ ] Deploy and test
- [ ] Configure custom domain (optional)

### Post-Deployment
- [ ] Test full flow in production
- [ ] Monitor logs and errors
- [ ] Performance optimization

---

## 📋 Phase 6: Documentation & Polish

- [ ] Update README with setup instructions
- [ ] Document API endpoints
- [ ] Document agent behaviors
- [ ] Add environment variable templates
- [ ] Create deployment guide
- [ ] Add screenshots/demo video

---

## Progress Overview

**Stream 1 (Backend):** 0/8 major tasks
**Stream 2 (Frontend):** 0/8 major tasks
**Stream 3 (Database):** 0/7 major tasks

**Total Progress:** 1/50+ tasks completed

---

## Notes

- All three Claude instances can work in parallel on their respective folders
- Backend requires shared types from `/shared` folder
- Frontend can mock API initially for development
- Database should be set up first to provide schemas to backend

---

## Quick Start for Each Claude Instance

**Claude 1 (Backend):**
```bash
cd backend
npm init -y
npm install express typescript @types/node @types/express
# See claude1-todo.md for full instructions
```

**Claude 2 (Frontend):**
```bash
cd frontend
npx create-next-app@latest . --typescript --tailwind --app
# See claude2-todo.md for full instructions
```

**Claude 3 (Database):**
```bash
cd database
npm init -y
npm install mongodb mongoose
# See claude3-todo.md for full instructions
```
